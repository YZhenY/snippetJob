/* Three different strats:
    1. Simple category templating simlar to above
    2. Within longer segments split that into a build tree which builds on phrases;
    sequential structure (each node given a number, numbers determing which rank it can be, 
    seperate rank probabilities perhaps)
    3. Same as above but instead of sequential structure, nodes connect to every one of the other nodes
    creating a graph like structure with scores according to what follows

    How to think about this?
        - Amount of data i can EXPECT to have from feedback.... MOST EFFCIENT WITH WHAT I HAVE
        - SCALABILITY
        - Clear issues with links?
